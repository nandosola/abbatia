# Meek surrender

> I help people get what they want. Unapologetically.

::: {.quote-author}
Jenny Wood, Wild Courage (2025)
:::

There's something energizing about Jenny Wood's message[^1]. It's bold. It's clean. It tells you: stop apologizing, figure out what you want, and go get it.
But there's something else beneath the surface. Something that should give us pause — especially if we're serious about building not just careers, but character.

## Are your desires really your guide?

_Wild Courage_ teaches that what holds you back is fear. That you just need to dig deep, discover what you want, and go after it.
But not all desires are good just because they're yours. Not everything you want is what will make you whole. Sometimes we desire what's shiny but empty.
Sometimes we fear what's hard but holy. Real growth begins when you stop asking, "What do I want?" And start asking, "What is good?"

The Catholic Tradition reminds us that true freedom is not doing whatever we want, but choosing what is right. And what is right is not something we invent: it is given to us. There is a natural law, a moral compass written in our hearts by the Creator, inclining us toward the supreme Good, which is God Himself.

Sometimes, what is right is what we would never have chosen without grace, because grace heals and elevates our wounded freedom. Elevating the jettison of our fall from grace into supposed virtues is a bad start. We cannot redefine brokenness as strength. Prideful control, disordered passion, and the loss of shame and charity: this is how a soul crumbles when it stops seeking the Face of God.

Yet even before someone knows Christ, every sincere desire for truth, goodness, or beauty already carries within it the quiet trace of God’s help. The Church teaches that grace doesn’t override our freedom — it heals it and lifts it up, even at the very beginning. What we often call "personal initiative", when directed toward what is truly good, is already a response to God drawing the soul forward. But grace never stops there: it purifies, it redirects — and in the end, it saves.

True strength lies in admitting our need for healing and allowing God to restore the original harmony He intended for us.

Saint Thérèse of Lisieux expressed it simply:

> Holiness consists simply in doing His will, and being just what He wants us to be.

And what He wills is often very different from what our wounded hearts first desire.

## The courage to disappear

Jenny encourages people to "get seen, get heard, get ahead". There's merit in speaking up — especially when you've been silenced. But maybe the deepest form of courage is not standing out, but laying your life down for others, as an act of love.

The world says: "Assert yourself". But the saints say: "Forget yourself".

Some of the greatest people I know live hidden lives. They raise children with gentleness. They carry invisible burdens. They say "no" to comfort so others can flourish. And they don't post about it. That, too, is courage. And it is the courage of the Cross.

Our Little Thérèse reminds us:

> To pick up a pin for love can convert a soul.

The smallest acts, invisible to the world, shine brighter in Heaven than all public victories.

## When fear is your friend

_Wild Courage_ says: "Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear".

But what if fear is not always the enemy? What if fear is the beginning of humility? Sometimes fear is your soul's way of saying: "This isn't good for me". Or: "I'm not the center of the universe". Or even: "Maybe I need help".

Courage isn't doing what you want despite fear. It's doing what's right even when you're afraid —especially when it costs you something.

::: {.important}
Fear can be a signal from God.
A holy stoplight. A hidden grace.
Not an obstacle, but an invitation to surrender.
To fall without knowing where you'll land — because you trust Who will catch you.

To reach the point of saying, like that baptized young woman who died at twenty-four:

> I have done nothing humanly. I have done nothing supernaturally. I am ready for the mercy of God.

Fr. Marie-Dominique Molinié, OP. Courage to Be Afraid
:::

This is the courage that matters: not the courage to make noise, but the courage to fall silently into the arms of Christ. You will be remembered not for what you achieved, but for how much you let yourself be loved.

As the Apostle reminds us:

> Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear: because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not perfected in charity.

::: {.quote-author}
1 John 4:18
:::

It is not by striving to leave a mark that we overcome fear, but by letting ourselves be consumed by the perfect love of Christ.

## Ardet nec consumitur

Many self-help programs promise to light a fire in you. _Wild Courage_ is no different. It's energetic, no-nonsense, driven. But be careful.

There are fires that give warmth and life — and there are fires that devour the soul while the face still smiles. We are not machines to be optimized or performers to be applauded. We are immortal souls, created in the image of God, sprung from the eternal abundance of His love, entrusted with freedom, and wounded by our own sin. Yet in the fullness of time, our Lord Jesus Christ took upon Himself our fallen nature, and by His Passion restored what we could not repair.

Grace is not a motivational spark. It is the fire of divine charity, bestowed not upon the strong, but upon those who are broken and poor in spirit. It is a fire that melts pride, burns away self-love, and heals what human effort cannot reach.

Souls are not forged by ambition or noise, but in the silence of prayer, in the mystery of the sacraments, and in suffering embraced with Christ crucified — where all that is false is consumed, and only what is eternal remains.

> And he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.

## How to die successfully

Jenny's credentials are impressive — Google, billions in revenue, thousands coached. She's clearly gifted. But success is not holiness. Visibility is not virtue. And confidence is not wisdom.

The people who truly change the world are often the ones who never get credit for it. And that's okay. Because what matters most is not getting ahead, but staying faithful.
The goal of our life is not professional success, public recognition, or personal fulfillment.

We are called to holiness, not to worldly greatness. And that, very often, will look like failure to the world. The goal is to die in the state of grace — to die as friends of God.

## Post scriptum

Jenny Wood's framework, like many in the modern world, follows a familiar threefold rhythm:

1. Withdrawal – You stop apologizing. You stop hiding. _You break free_.
2. Shattering – You defy expectations. You challenge conventions. _You disrupt_.
3. Restoration – You rebuild yourself. You brand yourself. _You rise authentically_. But towards an ideal that cannot be achieved. So you go back to point #2.

This is what I call a _pattern of perpetual seeking_: a false mysticism where the ego plays both exile and savior. It promises transcendence through performance. Glory through friction.

But this pattern traps the soul in a closed circuit: break down, rebuild, break again — a restless spiral with no exit, because it never escapes the self.
Worse still, it doesn't liberate the ego — it enthrones it, locking it within a polished hyper-reality of endless striving.

There is only one reality that shatters this illusion: The Cross of Jesus Christ. The real one. Not the stylized one. Not the marketable one. A reality that:

- Does not ask you to rise. It calls you to fall — into mercy, not performance.
- Does not promise to make you seen. It offers to make you whole.
- Does not feed your will. It crucifies it — and in that, makes it new.
- Does not help you get what you want. It helps you desire what is rightly ordered to the good.

### Philosophical addendum: gnostic roots of self-help culture

The _Law of Attraction_ and the self-made _Wild Courage_ mindset both borrow heavily from ancient Gnostic ideas:

- That the true power lies hidden inside you.
- That the material world resists you but can be reshaped by your will.
- That salvation is found by unlocking secret potentials within.

Similarly, Nietzsche's ethics of the _Übermensch_ taught that good and evil are dead, and that true strength is the self's ability to will its own destiny without apology. Thus, modern self-help movements are not merely secular: they are deeply spiritual counterfeits, offering a false transcendence through self-worship, rather than humble reception of grace.
Against these illusions, Catholic faith stands firm:

::: {.important}
We are not saviors of ourselves. We are beggars before a loving God.
:::

_The Law of Attraction_ and _Wild Courage_ are just another form the old gnosis: the belief that you can save yourself by being brave enough, strategic enough, perfect enough.

For those seeking a deeper antidote to modern illusions of strength, we warmly recommend the short yet profound book Courage to Be Afraid[^2] by Marie-Dominique Molinié — a meditation on true spiritual fortitude in the spirit of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.

Alongside it, Story of a Soul[^3], the autobiography of Saint Thérèse herself, reveals the hidden power of her _little way_: a path of trust, littleness, and surrender that defeats the world's obsession with greatness.

### Cogitatio ultima

You don't need a masterclass to matter. You don't need to monetize your confidence to be strong. And you don't need to get what you want to become who you're meant to be. Sometimes the best things in life come not when we demand them, but when we accept them with humility.

The world says: "Create your destiny".

But the Holy Mother of God teaches us to say: _"Let it be done unto me." (Luke 1:38)_

And the disciple who took her into his home — the one whom Jesus loved — echoes her fiat in his epistle:

> And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof: but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.

::: {.quote-author}
1 John 2:17
:::

Everything you see will crumble. Only obedience to Love will endure. Because our true destiny is not to build a name for ourselves, but to lose ourselves in the One Name that saves.

The world will measure you by what you built. God will measure you by how much you loved Him.
