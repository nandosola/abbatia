        <p>Jenny Wood, Wild Courage<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
        </div>
        <p>There’s something energizing about Jenny Wood’s message. It’s
        bold. It’s clean. It tells you: stop apologizing, figure out
        what you want, and go get it. But there’s something else beneath
        the surface. Something that should give us pause — especially if
        we’re serious about building not just careers, but
        character.</p>
        <h2 id="are-your-desires-really-your-guide">Are your desires
        really your guide?</h2>
        <p><em>Wild Courage</em> teaches that what holds you back is
        fear. That you just need to dig deep, discover what you want,
        and go after it. But not all desires are good just because
        they’re yours. Not everything you want is what will make you
        whole. Sometimes we desire what’s shiny but empty. Sometimes we
        fear what’s hard but holy. Real growth begins when you stop
        asking, “What do I want?” And start asking, “What is good?”</p>
        <p>The Catholic Tradition reminds us that true freedom is not
        doing whatever we want, but choosing what is right. And what is
        right is not something we invent: it is given to us. There is a
        natural law, a moral compass written in our hearts by the
        Creator, inclining us toward the supreme Good, which is God
        Himself.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, what is right is what we would never have chosen
        without grace, because grace heals and elevates our wounded
        freedom. Elevating the jettison of our fall from grace into
        supposed virtues is a bad start. We cannot redefine brokenness
        as strength. Prideful control, disordered passion, and the loss
        of shame and charity: this is how a soul crumbles when it stops
        seeking the Face of God.</p>
        <p>Yet even before someone knows Christ, every sincere desire
        for truth, goodness, or beauty already carries within it the
        quiet trace of God’s help. The Church teaches that grace doesn’t
        override our freedom — it heals it and lifts it up, even at the
        very beginning. What we often call “personal initiative”, when
        directed toward what is truly good, is already a response to God
        drawing the soul forward. But grace never stops there: it
        purifies, it redirects — and in the end, it saves.</p>
        <p>True strength lies in admitting our need for healing and
        allowing God to restore the original harmony He intended for
        us.</p>
        <p>Saint Thérèse of Lisieux expressed it simply:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Holiness consists simply in doing His will, and being just
        what He wants us to be.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>And what He wills is often very different from what our
        wounded hearts first desire.</p>
        <h2 id="the-courage-to-disappear">The courage to disappear</h2>
        <p>Jenny encourages people to “get seen, get heard, get ahead”.
        There’s merit in speaking up — especially when you’ve been
        silenced. But maybe the deepest form of courage is not standing
        out, but laying your life down for others, as an act of
        love.</p>
        <p>The world says: “Assert yourself”. But the saints say:
        “Forget yourself”.</p>
        <p>Some of the greatest people I know live hidden lives. They
        raise children with gentleness. They carry invisible burdens.
        They say “no” to comfort so others can flourish. And they don’t
        post about it. That, too, is courage. And it is the courage of
        the Cross.</p>
        <p>Our Little Thérèse reminds us:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To pick up a pin for love can convert a soul.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The smallest acts, invisible to the world, shine brighter in
        Heaven than all public victories.</p>
        <h2 id="when-fear-is-your-friend">When fear is your friend</h2>
        <p><em>Wild Courage</em> says: “Everything you’ve ever wanted is
        on the other side of fear”.</p>
        <p>But what if fear is not always the enemy? What if fear is the
        beginning of humility? Sometimes fear is your soul’s way of
        saying: “This isn’t good for me”. Or: “I’m not the center of the
        universe”. Or even: “Maybe I need help”.</p>
        <p>Courage isn’t doing what you want despite fear. It’s doing
        what’s right even when you’re afraid —especially when it costs
        you something.</p>
        <div class="important">
        <p>Fear can be a signal from God. A holy stoplight. A hidden
        grace. Not an obstacle, but an invitation to surrender. To fall
        without knowing where you’ll land — because you trust Who will
        catch you.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To reach the point of saying, like that baptized young woman
        who died at twenty-four:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I have done nothing humanly. I have done nothing
        supernaturally. I am ready for the mercy of God.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="quote-author">
        <p>Fr. Marie-Dominique Molinié, OP. Courage to Be Afraid</p>
        </div>
        <p>This is the courage that matters: not the courage to make
        noise, but the courage to fall silently into the arms of Christ.
        You will be remembered not for what you achieved, but for how
        much you let yourself be loved.</p>
        <p>As the Apostle reminds us:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Fear is not in charity: but perfect charity casteth out fear:
        because fear hath pain. And he that feareth, is not perfected in
        charity.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="quote-author">
        <p>1 John 4:18</p>
        </div>
        <p>It is not by striving to leave a mark that we overcome fear,
        but by letting ourselves be consumed by the perfect love of
        Christ.</p>
        <h2 id="ardet-nec-consumitur">Ardet nec consumitur</h2>
        <p>Many self-help programs promise to light a fire in you.
        <em>Wild Courage</em> is no different. It’s energetic,
        no-nonsense, driven. But be careful.</p>
        <p>There are fires that give warmth and life — and there are
        fires that devour the soul while the face still smiles. We are
        not machines to be optimized or performers to be applauded. We
        are immortal souls, created in the image of God, sprung from the
        eternal abundance of His love, entrusted with freedom, and
        wounded by our own sin. Yet in the fullness of time, our Lord
        Jesus Christ took upon Himself our fallen nature, and by His
        Passion restored what we could not repair.</p>
        <p>Grace is not a motivational spark. It is the fire of divine
        charity, bestowed not upon the strong, but upon those who are
        broken and poor in spirit. It is a fire that melts pride, burns
        away self-love, and heals what human effort cannot reach.</p>
        <p>Souls are not forged by ambition or noise, but in the silence
        of prayer, in the mystery of the sacraments, and in suffering
        embraced with Christ crucified — where all that is false is
        consumed, and only what is eternal remains.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>And he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.</p>

        <p>Jenny’s credentials are impressive — Google, billions in
        revenue, thousands coached. She’s clearly gifted. But success is
        not holiness. Visibility is not virtue. And confidence is not
        wisdom.</p>
        <p>The people who truly change the world are often the ones who
        never get credit for it. And that’s okay. Because what matters
        most is not getting ahead, but staying faithful. The goal of our
        life is not professional success, public recognition, or
        personal fulfillment.</p>
        <p>We are called to holiness, not to worldly greatness. And
        that, very often, will look like failure to the world. The goal
        is to die in the state of grace — to die as friends of God.</p>

        <h2 id="post-scriptum">Post scriptum</h2>
        <p>Jenny Wood’s framework, like many in the modern world,
        follows a familiar threefold rhythm:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Withdrawal – You stop apologizing. You stop hiding. <em>You
        break free</em>.</li>
        <li>Shattering – You defy expectations. You challenge
        conventions. <em>You disrupt</em>.</li>
        <li>Restoration – You rebuild yourself. You brand yourself.
        <em>You rise authentically</em>. But towards an ideal that
        cannot be achieved. So you go back to point #2.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is what I call a <em>pattern of perpetual seeking</em>:
        a false mysticism where the ego plays both exile and savior. It
        promises transcendence through performance. Glory through
        friction.</p>
        <p>But this pattern traps the soul in a closed circuit: break
        down, rebuild, break again — a restless spiral with no exit,
        because it never escapes the self. Worse still, it doesn’t
        liberate the ego — it enthrones it, locking it within a polished
        hyper-reality of endless striving.</p>
        <p>There is only one reality that shatters this illusion: The
        Cross of Jesus Christ. The real one. Not the stylized one. Not
        the marketable one. A reality that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Does not ask you to rise. It calls you to fall — into mercy,
        not performance.</li>
        <li>Does not promise to make you seen. It offers to make you
        whole.</li>
        <li>Does not feed your will. It crucifies it — and in that,
        makes it new.</li>
        <li>Does not help you get what you want. It helps you desire
        what is rightly ordered to the good.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the

        <h3
        id="philosophical-addendum-gnostic-roots-of-self-help-culture">Philosophical
        addendum: gnostic roots of self-help culture</h3>
        <p>The <em>Law of Attraction</em> and the self-made <em>Wild
        Courage</em> mindset both borrow heavily from ancient Gnostic
        ideas:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>That the true power lies hidden inside you.</li>
        <li>That the material world resists you but can be reshaped by
        your will.</li>
        <li>That salvation is found by unlocking secret potentials
        within.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Similarly, Nietzsche’s ethics of the <em>Übermensch</em>
        taught that good and evil are dead, and that true strength is
        the self’s ability to will its own destiny without apology.
        Thus, modern self-help movements are not merely secular: they
        are deeply spiritual counterfeits, offering a false
        transcendence through self-worship, rather than humble reception
        of grace. Against these illusions, Catholic faith stands
        firm:</p>
        <div class="important">
        <p>We are not saviors of ourselves. We are beggars before a
        loving God.</p>
        </div>
        <p><em>The Law of Attraction</em> and <em>Wild Courage</em> are
        just another form the old gnosis: the belief that you can save
        yourself by being brave enough, strategic enough, perfect
        enough.</p>
        <p>For those seeking a deeper antidote to modern illusions of
        strength, we warmly recommend the short yet profound book
        Courage to Be Afraid<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> by
        Marie-Dominique Molinié — a meditation on true spiritual
        fortitude in the spirit of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux.</p>
        <p>Alongside it, Story of a Soul<a href="#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, the autobiography of Saint
        Thérèse herself, reveals the hidden power of her <em>little
        way</em>: a path of trust, littleness, and surrender that
        defeats the world’s obsession with greatness.</p>
        <h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
        <p>You don’t need a masterclass to matter. You don’t need to
        monetize your confidence to be strong. And you don’t need to get
        what you want to become who you’re meant to be. Sometimes the
        best things in life come not when we demand them, but when we
        accept them with humility.</p>
        <p>The world says: “Create your destiny”.</p>
        <p>But the Holy Mother of God teaches us to say: <em>“Let it be
        done unto me.” (Luke 1:38)</em></p>
        <p>And the disciple who took her into his home — the one whom
        Jesus loved — echoes her fiat in his epistle:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>And the world passeth away, and the concupiscence thereof:
        but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <div class="quote-author">
        <p>1 John 2:17</p>
        </div>
        <p>Everything you see will crumble. Only obedience to Love will
        endure. Because our true destiny is not to build a name for
        ourselves, but to lose ourselves in the One Name that saves.</p>
        <p>The world will measure you by what you built. God will
        measure you by how much you loved Him.</p>
